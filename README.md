# README

## Overview
This repository contains multiple projects completed during academic courses as well as personal practice projects. Each project showcases different aspects of hardware design and verification using Verilog and SystemVerilog, with an emphasis on understanding and implementing various digital design concepts.

## Projects

### UVM RISC V Project
This project involves the design and verification of a RISC-V processor using Universal Verification Methodology (UVM). The project includes the following components:
- **RISC-V Core Design:** The design of a RISC-V core, including its ALU, register file, control unit, and memory interface.
- **Testbench Development:** Creation of a UVM testbench to verify the functionality of the RISC-V core.
- **Assertions and Coverage:** Implementation of assertions and functional coverage to ensure thorough verification of the processor design.

### Design of 1x3 Router
This project focuses on the design of a 1x3 router, which routes data from one input channel to one of three output channels based on control signals. The project includes:
- **Router Architecture:** Design of the router's internal architecture, including its control logic and data path.
- **Verilog Implementation:** Implementation of the router design in Verilog.
- **Simulation and Verification:** Development of testbenches to simulate and verify the correct operation of the route

### Floating Point MAC with Synchronous FIFO 
This project involves the design of a Floating Point Multiply-Accumulate (MAC) unit. The key aspects of this project are:
- **Floating Point Arithmetic:** Understanding and implementing floating-point arithmetic operations based on IEEE 754 standards.
- **MAC Unit Design:** Design of a MAC unit that performs floating-point multiplication followed by addition.
- **Verilog Coding:** Coding the MAC unit in Verilog and ensuring it handles various edge cases and exceptional conditions.


## Usage
Each project folder contains the necessary source code, testbenches, and documentation. To run the simulations and tests, use a Verilog/SystemVerilog simulator like ModelSim or VCS. Detailed instructions for setting up and running each project are provided within the respective project folders.
